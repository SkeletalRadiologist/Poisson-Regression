data <- data.frame(c(rep(5:6,50), rpois(900,1)),
            c(rep("A",100),sample(c("A","B"),900, replace=T)),
            c(sample(c("HIVD","stenosis"),500, replace=T)),

## With this set up the first 100 subjects received treatment A
## and had high number of post-treatment interventions (5 or 6)
## and were also older,
## guaranteing that they will be significant factors in the following
## Poisson regression:

head(data)

POIS <-glm(Post_Treat_Interventions~Treatment+Diagnosis+Approach+Age,
           family="poisson",data=data)

exp(cbind(COEF=coef(POIS),confint(POIS)))

#COEF     2.5 %    97.5 %
#  (Intercept)         0.1415239 0.1002669 0.1985416
#TreatmentB            0.7305948 0.6513643 0.8182657
#Diagnosisstenosis     0.9603871 0.8658282 1.0650717
#Approachinterlam.     1.0214885 0.9014026 1.1572253
#Approachtransforam.   0.9675647 0.8532679 1.0968184
#Age                   1.0319382 1.0279856 1.0359522

## As expected, the CI for Age do not include 1 (i.e. it's a statistically 
## significant factor in the regression),
## and we can expect a 3% increase in the number of post-procedure interventions
## with Age.
## Also as per design, the cause of stenosis makes no difference, or the approach.
## And Treatment B is indeed better, because it results in only 
## 66% of the number or repeat interventions compared to treatment A.
