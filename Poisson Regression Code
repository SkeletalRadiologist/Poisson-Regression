## With this set-up the first 500 subjects received treatment A
## and had high number of post-treatment interventions (3 or 4) and were also older, 
##guaranteing that they will be significant factors in the following Poisson regression:

POIS <-glm(Post_Treat_Interventions~Treatment+Diagnosis+Approach+Age,
           family="poisson",data=data)

exp(cbind(COEF=coef(POIS),confint(POIS)))

#                         COEF       2.5 %              97.5 %
#(Intercept)         1.4414700      0.9080323          2.283861
#TreatmentB          0.7403763      0.6363773          0.861333
#Diagnosisstenosis   0.9611561      0.8916945          1.035883
#Approachinterlam.   0.9537961      0.8715821          1.043625
#Approachtransforam. 0.9500726      0.8668225          1.041084
#Age                 1.0107853      1.0055561          1.016048

## As expected, the CI for Age do not include 1 (i.e. it's a statistically significant factor in the regression),
## and we can expect a 1% increase in the number of post-procedure interventions with Age.
## Also as per design, the cause of stenosis makes no difference, or the approach.
## And Treatment B is indeed better, because it results in only 
## 74% of the number or repeat interventions compared to treatment A.


## As a word of caution, check the residual deviance against the degrees of freedom in...
